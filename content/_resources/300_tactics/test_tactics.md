## Why These Tactics Are Useful for the PMP Exam

The PMP exam is full of scenario-based questions that test a candidate’s ability to think like a professional project manager. These lists align well with PMI’s expectations in the following ways:

### **1. "Don’t Do" List – Avoiding Bad Project Management Practices**
- PMP questions often include distractor choices that reflect poor leadership, lack of ownership, or unethical behavior.  
- The "Don't Do" list helps candidates eliminate these wrong answers quickly.  

#### **Examples:**
- **"Don’t Hire / Fire"** → A PMP should follow HR processes, not unilaterally hire/fire.  
- **"Don’t Ask for Money"** → PMP candidates should focus on budget management, not last-minute funding requests.  
- **"Don’t Ask for Help"** → A PMP should collaborate and communicate, not avoid teamwork.  
- **"Don’t Do Nothing"** → PMP expects proactive risk and issue management.  
- **"Don’t Make Someone Else Do Your Job"** → PMP-certified PMs are accountable and can’t pass off responsibilities.  

### **2. "Do This" List – Following PMP Best Practices**
- These behaviors reflect leadership, collaboration, problem-solving, and value-driven decision-making, all of which PMI assesses.  

#### **Examples:**
- **"Deliver value"** → The PMP exam emphasizes the business value of project outcomes.  
- **"Be direct and collaborative"** → Effective communication is a top PMP skill.  
- **"Be honest and take responsibility"** → PMP-certified PMs follow ethics and integrity, avoiding blame-shifting.  
- **"Problem solve, problem solve, problem solve"** → This mirrors PMI’s structured problem-solving approach: define, analyze, solve, implement, verify.  
- **"Verify that it worked"** → The PMP exam tests continuous improvement and lessons learned, ensuring solutions achieve results.  

## How This Helps on the PMP Exam

- **Eliminating wrong answers** – PMP questions often include unethical, ineffective, or overly bureaucratic choices. Knowing what not to do helps narrow down options.  
- **Choosing PMI-preferred responses** – PMP expects proactive, ethical, and process-driven decisions, which align with the "Do This" list.  
- **Improving situational awareness** – The exam tests not just knowledge but how well you apply it to real-world scenarios.  

This structured approach makes it easier to spot the best answer quickly, saving time on the exam.
