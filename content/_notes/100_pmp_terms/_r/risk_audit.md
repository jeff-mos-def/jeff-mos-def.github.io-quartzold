A **Risk Audit** is a formal review of a project’s [[risk_management.md | risk management]] practices, designed to assess the effectiveness and relevance of how [[risk.md | risks]] are identified, assessed, and handled. Risk audits help determine if the risk processes and responses are being followed as planned and highlight opportunities for improvement.

## Key Aspects of a Risk Audit
- **Evaluates Risk Handling** – Reviews how well the project team is identifying and responding to risks.
- **Assesses Process Effectiveness** – Checks whether the risk management approach is being used correctly and efficiently.
- **Identifies Gaps and Barriers** – Uncovers any breakdowns in the risk process or issues limiting its success.
- **Supports Continuous Improvement** – Provides insights for refining risk strategies and practices.

## When to Conduct a Risk Audit
- **Periodically During the Project** – Scheduled audits can be part of regular project reviews.
- **After Key Milestones** – Helps evaluate how risks were handled in earlier phases before moving forward.
- **In Response to Issues** – Triggered when unexpected problems suggest weaknesses in risk management.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Implementation**
A team conducts a risk audit mid-project and discovers that most risk mitigation plans haven't been updated despite changes in scope. The audit prompts a realignment of risk responses.

### **Construction Project**
A construction manager orders a risk audit after repeated safety incidents. The audit reveals that hazard identification procedures are outdated and training compliance is low.

### **Product Launch**
Ahead of a major product release, a risk audit shows that contingency plans for supply chain delays are missing. The team adds mitigation strategies to protect the timeline.

## Why a Risk Audit Matters
- **Validates Risk Plans** – Ensures risk strategies are being used as intended.
- **Reduces Surprises** – Helps uncover overlooked or emerging risks.
- **Drives Accountability** – Clarifies roles and responsibilities in managing risk.
