The **Delphi Technique** is a **structured communication and forecasting method** used to gather and synthesize the opinions of a panel of experts. It relies on **anonymity, multiple rounds of questionnaires, and controlled feedback** to reach a group consensus on a complex problem or future outcome.

## **Key Aspects of the Delphi Technique**
- **Anonymity** – Participants' identities are kept secret to prevent bias and the influence of authority or personality.
- **Iterative Process** – The process involves multiple rounds of questionnaires, allowing experts to refine their opinions based on the group's feedback.
- **Controlled Feedback** – A facilitator summarizes the results from each round and provides this summary to the experts for the next round.
- **Expert Panel** – It leverages the collective knowledge of a group of geographically dispersed experts who do not need to meet face-to-face.
- **Statistical Analysis** – The facilitator often uses statistical measures (like median and interquartile ranges) to represent the group's consensus.

## **The Delphi Process**
| **Step** | **Description** | **Key Action** |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Select Facilitator & Experts** | A neutral facilitator is chosen, and a panel of diverse experts on the subject is recruited. | Identify and invite relevant subject matter experts. |
| **2. First Round Questionnaire** | The facilitator sends a broad, open-ended questionnaire to the experts to gather initial ideas or opinions. | Experts provide their individual, unattributed responses. |
| **3. Consolidate & Summarize** | The facilitator collects and analyzes the anonymous responses, grouping them and summarizing the key points. | A summary report of the first round is created. |
| **4. Subsequent Rounds** | The summary is sent back to the experts along with a more structured second questionnaire. Experts review the summary and can revise their initial judgments. | This process is repeated for several rounds (usually 2-4) until consensus is reached. |
| **5. Final Report** | Once the results stabilize and a consensus is achieved, the facilitator compiles and issues a final report documenting the outcomes. | The final report represents the collective, refined judgment of the expert panel. |

## **Example Scenarios**

### **Risk Identification**
A project team distributed across multiple countries uses the Delphi Technique to **identify potential [[risk.md | risks]]** for a complex industrial [[project.md | project]], ensuring local and global perspectives are captured without bias.

### **Technology Forecasting**
A tech company uses it to **predict the adoption rate of a new AI technology** over the next ten years by polling industry analysts, academics, and internal R&D leaders.

### **Cost & Effort Estimation**
For a first-of-its-kind project, a project manager uses the technique to **estimate the total effort and cost** by gathering anonymous input from senior engineers and architects.

## **Why The Delphi Technique Matters**
- **Reduces Bias** – Anonymity mitigates the "halo effect" and prevents dominant personalities from swaying the outcome.
- **Overcomes Geographical Constraints** – Allows input from the best experts, regardless of their physical location.
- **Generates High-Quality Consensus** – The structured, iterative process leads to a more thoughtful and well-supported conclusion than a typical meeting.
- **Excellent for Complex Problems** – Highly effective for situations with high uncertainty or a lack of historical data.
