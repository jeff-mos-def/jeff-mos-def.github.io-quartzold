A **Backlog** is an ordered list of work items that need to be completed in a project. In Agile project management, the backlog is often written as user stories and prioritized by the business to guide development and ensure the highest-value work is completed first.

## Key Aspects of a Backlog
- **Prioritized List** – Work items are arranged based on value, urgency, or dependencies.
- **Continuously Evolving** – Updated regularly as new requirements emerge.
- **Guides Project Work** – Provides a structured approach to task management.
- **Divided into Different Types** – Can include product features, bug fixes, technical tasks, or research items.

## Types of Backlogs
- **Product Backlog** – A high-level list of features and requirements for the entire project or product.
- **Sprint Backlog** – A subset of the product backlog, containing work items selected for completion in a specific sprint.
- **Release Backlog** – Items scheduled for an upcoming software or product release.

## Example Scenarios

### **Software Development**
A development team maintains a product backlog with features such as "Add user authentication" and "Implement dark mode." Items are pulled into sprints based on priority.

### **Marketing Campaign**
A marketing team uses a backlog to track campaign tasks like "Design social media ads" and "Write promotional blog post," prioritizing them based on launch deadlines.

### **Construction Project**
A construction team organizes a backlog of tasks like "Install electrical wiring" and "Complete plumbing system," prioritizing work based on dependencies.

## Why a Backlog Matters
- **Improves Work Organization** – Ensures teams focus on the most important tasks first.
- **Enhances Adaptability** – Allows adjustments to priorities as project needs evolve.
- **Facilitates Collaboration** – Aligns team members and stakeholders on what needs to be done.
