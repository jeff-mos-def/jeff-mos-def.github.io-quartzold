title: Jeff's PMP Study Notes
date: 3-19-2025

Welcome! My name is Jeff, and I’m currently studying for the [[project_management_professional.md | Project Management Professional (PMP)]] certification. I’m a [SAFe 6 SPC](https://framework.scaledagile.com/spc) and have worked as a **Technical Program Manager** in roles supporting the **U.S. Air Force**.  

This site is built with [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to organize my PMP study materials in a structured, linked format. By studying in public, I’m reinforcing my learning while making these resources available for others preparing for the PMP exam.  

You'll find notes on **PMP process groups, knowledge areas, and key project management concepts**, mapped together for easy reference. Since Quartz allows for knowledge linking, you can explore related topics as you navigate the content.  

I'll keep updating the site as I progress. Hope this helps!
