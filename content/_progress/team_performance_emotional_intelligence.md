### Learning Points  
- Emotional intelligence supports conflict resolution by focusing on root causes rather than escalation.  
- Psychological safety is critical to high-performing teams; leaders must actively maintain it.  
- Distinguishing between issue logs, immediate action, and escalation paths is a recurring challenge in scenario-based questions.  
- Judging when to apply schedule compression techniques (crashing vs. fast tracking) relies on understanding cost, risk, and stakeholder expectations.  
- Negotiating for resources is often favored over escalation when resolving resourcing conflicts.
